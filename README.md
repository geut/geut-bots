The place for GEUT bots :robot:

___

##  Organization

This is a monorepo for the Chassis project. The Chassis project involves not only a library but also, services and plugins. Here you can find the modules maintaned by GEUT.

## Library

[Chassis](/packages/chassis) is a library for creating bots. There are different kind of bots and we hope Chassis could help you create your own bot easily.

## Services

In real world there are many different (communication) services where Chassis can be used. These services provides Chassis a way to connect your bot with the world. Below you can find a list of services:

- [Slack _simple_ service](/packages/slack-service)

## Plugins

Chassis can be extended using a plugins system. Every bot has lifecycle hooks which can be used to modularize and split logic into reusable units.
